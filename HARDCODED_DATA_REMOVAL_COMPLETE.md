## 📋 Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start Services

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
cp env-ready-to-use.txt .env
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
cd WorkerConnect-2
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create Test Data

**Register Test Worker**:
- Go to Worker Registration
- Aadhaar: `111122223333`
- Name: Test Worker
- Mobile: `9111111111`
- Password: `Test@123`

**Register Test Establishment**:
- Go to Establishment Registration
- Name: Test Construction
- Mobile: `9222222222`
- Email: `test@construction.com`
- Password: `Test@123`

### 3. Test All Pages

Navigate through all department pages:
- Department Dashboard - Should show stats
- Establishment Management - Should show Test Construction
- Application Review - Should show applications
- Compliance Monitoring - Shows empty (OK)
- Document Verification - Shows empty (OK)
- Attendance History - Shows records after check-in
- Reports - Shows real worker/establishment counts

## 🎯 Success Criteria - All Met!

- ✅ No hardcoded data in any frontend page
- ✅ All pages fetch data from backend APIs
- ✅ Proper error handling implemented
- ✅ Loading states added
- ✅ Empty states handled gracefully
- ✅ Backend endpoints created and working
- ✅ API responses properly mapped to UI
- ✅ No console errors with empty database
- ✅ No console errors with populated database

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Page Shows Empty But Should Have Data

**Check**:
1. Backend is running on port 3001
2. Database has data (check Supabase Table Editor)
3. Browser console for API errors
4. Network tab shows 200 responses

### API Returns Empty Array

**Solutions**:
1. Register test data first
2. Check database directly in Supabase
3. Verify SQL scripts ran successfully
4. Check backend console for errors

### CORS Errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify backend is running
2. Check FRONTEND_URL in backend `.env`
3. Restart backend after .env changes
