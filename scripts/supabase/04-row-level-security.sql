/*
In your backend API, after successful authentication, call:
- For workers: SELECT set_worker_context(123);
- For establishments: SELECT set_establishment_context(456);
- For department: SELECT set_department_context(789, 'Admin');
- For service operations: SELECT enable_service_role_bypass();

Or use Supabase service role key which automatically bypasses RLS.
