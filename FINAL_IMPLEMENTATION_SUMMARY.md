## 🧪 API Testing

Test your backend with these curl commands:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Get states
curl http://localhost:3001/api/location/states

# Get categories
curl http://localhost:3001/api/establishmentcategory/details

# Register worker
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/worker/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"aadhaarNumber":"123456789012","firstName":"Test","lastName":"Worker","gender":"male","dateOfBirth":"1990-01-01","mobileNumber":"9876543210","password":"Test@123"}'

# Login worker
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/worker/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mobileNumber":"9876543210","password":"Test@123"}'
```

## 💡 Important Notes

### Placeholder Features
Some features don't have database tables yet (future enhancements):
- **Compliance Tracking** - Returns empty array
- **Document Management** - Returns empty array

These endpoints exist and work, but return empty data until you add the corresponding database tables and logic.

### Location Coordinates
- Currently using placeholders for worker/establishment locations
- **TODO**: Add `latitude`/`longitude` columns to database for accurate map display

### Optional Features
- Full-text search indexes are commented out (requires `pg_trgm` extension)
- Can be enabled later if needed for advanced search

---

## 🎊 Summary

### ✅ What Works Now:
- Complete authentication system (worker, establishment, department)
- Worker registration and management
- Establishment registration and management  
- Attendance tracking (check-in/check-out)
- Dashboard statistics (real-time)
- Application review (pending registrations)
- Reports (aggregated from database)
- Master data (states, districts, categories, etc.)

### ⏳ Future Enhancements:
- Compliance tracking (database table needed)
- Document management (Supabase Storage integration)
- Accurate GPS coordinates (add to database)
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced analytics
- Mobile app optimizations

### Troubleshooting:
1. Backend won't start → Check `.env` file exists
2. Database errors → Verify SQL scripts ran successfully
3. CORS errors → Ensure backend is running on port 3001
4. Empty data → Register test workers/establishments first
